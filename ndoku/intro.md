# NDoku Math

This project focuses on determining various counts relating to the popular Ndoku games (sudoku and it's variants).
We will work towards computing known counts and try to improve the ways in which we do this. 

Hope y'all enjoy the weird corner of my brain that is taken up by how many sudokus there are :P
